This indicates a hardware problem, or a bug in the software, or a bad software modification that allowed an invalid snapshot to be loaded. As a result of this, the node will shut down and stop using any state that was built on the snapshot, resetting the chain height from 210 to 110. On the next restart, the node will resume syncing from 110 without using any snapshot data. Please report this incident to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues, including how you obtained the snapshot. The invalid snapshot chainstate has been left on disk in case it is helpful in diagnosing the issue that caused this error.
