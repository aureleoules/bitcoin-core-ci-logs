84711b18b build-unix.txt: Updated (now OK to use wxWidgets > 2.9.0).
84778a5b4 makefile.unix: Fixed errors building bitcoind without wxWidgets installed.     WXINCLUDEPATHS and WXLIBS now assigned with '=' instead of ':='.     This means they are only evaluated on-demand, and they will never be     requested by 'make bitcoind', so it won't try to call wx-config.
3415b15a5 makefile.unix: WXINCLUDEPATHS now only used for building GUI object files.     Moved it out of CXXFLAGS and into the command-line for the GUI objects.     It will no longer be invoked for non-GUI and crypto object files.
8314b7f5e makefile.unix: Removed redundant use of wx-config in DEFS (it was being included twice).     Also changed wx-config --cppflags to --cxxflags. I am not sure what the     difference is supposed to be, but --cppflags does not include -pthread.
